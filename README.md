# Discord verclo bot
-verclo stands for verification over cloud

-following is the algorithm of how i am trying to make this bot work.
-1.the bot wil work 24/7 on aws lambda
-2.bot will take mail id from user and check if its valid
-3.if yes, it will send a code to the user's mail and as him to input the code
-4.if the code matches, the bot will assign the role to the user as verified
-5. the bot will save user's unique id,mail,etc in a mysql database with time

-current stage
-i have checked the status that the bot stays online as long as the script runs, it can manage message

-vision
-looking forwords to take this proejct forther and improve it for everyone
